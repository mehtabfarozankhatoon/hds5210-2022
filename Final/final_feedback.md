# Feedback on Final

The topic you picked for your final project worked well, and I like the problem statement you opened with. It provided a good set of data for you to work with, but you didn't provide documentation on where your data came from. What was your source?

Throughout the final project, the flow of steps was easy to follow, but it wasn't always clear where you were going with each step because you didn't include much documentation. It would have been helpful to have each section begin with a short paragraph to introduce what you were doing and how it supported the goal of the final.

Sometimes, you chose variable names that weren't very helpful in keeping track of what your code was doing.  For example, in section 2, you named the data frame for the countries-aggregated.xlsx file `AA`. Maybe `AA` standard for something to do with "aggregated" data, but it isn't clear.

At the beginning, you posed the question: "How many new infections were recorded after vaccinations as compare to before," and I see where you tried to answer that question.  However, there's no explanation of the answer.  I'm not sure if your work actually answers the comparison concisely.  (-10 on Documentation and Professionalism)

Your use of functions was very limited and seems thrown in at the last minute. You should use functions to organize your work and provide test cases that validate how you are transforming data. (-4 from Modularity/Style)

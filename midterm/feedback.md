## Step 1
* Great work. Easy to understand.

## Step 2
* Nice. No comments.

## Step 3
* Good comments. 
* I like how you included the three special conditions as their own `if` branch, even though two of them could be consolidated. I think it makes the code easier to trace back to the requirements.
* I do think that not using the `else` for the default case might open up future coding changes to bugs.  As written, if you reach the `else` condition, there is something seriously wrong.

## Step 4
* Nice work. No comments.
